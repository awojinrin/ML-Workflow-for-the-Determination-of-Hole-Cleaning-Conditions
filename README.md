# STSE-2022-ML-Workflow-For-Predicting-Cuttings-Concentration-In-Deviated-And-Horizontal-Wells
A repo containing the data and Jupyter notebook where ensemble algorithms including RF, GradientBoost and AdaBoost are investigated to attempt predicting the downhole concentration of cuttings in oil wells using surface data. This forms part of my submission for the 2022 Students Technical Symposium and Exhibition paper contest.
